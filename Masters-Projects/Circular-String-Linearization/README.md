Implementation of a Suffix Tree Data Structure to find the smallest lexicographic cyclic rotation.
This is achieved by building the Suffix Tree with the given string repeated one time. So if String = "S" the Suffix Tree is built with "SS".
Then we traverse the Suffix Tree by the smallest lexicographic rule until we reach a depth that equals the initial String "S" length.
