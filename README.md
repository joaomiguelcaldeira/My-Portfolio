## [Analysis and Synthesis of Algorithms - Grade Predictor - C++](https://github.com/joaomiguelcaldeira/my-portfolio/tree/master/Bachelor-Projects/Grade-Predictor)

This project is a program made in C++ to predict the grade of a student’s project based on the grade of the student’s test by also knowing that students frequently exchange project solutions between them. This solution uses a graph to describe the relations between students, and uses a DFS to search for the highest grade in a circle of friends and apply it’s spread between them. This is the same as searching for the strongly connected components in the graph and searching for the highest grade in each SCC to get the best prediction of the students grades.

## [Analysis and Synthesis of Algorithms - Maximum-Flow-COVID-19 - C++](https://github.com/joaomiguelcaldeira/my-portfolio/tree/master/Bachelor-Projects/Maximum-Flow-COVID-19)

This project is a program made in C++ with the objective to calculate the maximum number of residents of a given city that can go to a supermarket without crossing eachothers paths given the current COVID-19 pandemic situation. The problem considers all the cities with a square pattern with straight streets going from East to West or North to South. Therefore the student describes the city in it’s solution as a quadrangular graph with vertex capacities and calculates the maximum flow, using Dinic’s algorithm, of that graph given a super source (the residents) and a super target (the supermarkets). The maximum flow shall be equal to the maximum number of people that can go to the supermarket safely.

## [Introduction to Algorithms and Data Structures -  Friendly Football Games Data Management - C](https://github.com/joaomiguelcaldeira/my-portfolio/tree/master/Bachelor-Projects/Friendly%20Football%20Games%20Data%20Management)

This project is a program made in C with the objective to develop a database management system of friendly football games. The system holds a database of the teams and games. The person interacts with the program through the command line giving certain commands to do specific actions. It is used a hashing table and a double linked list to store and search the data efficiently.
