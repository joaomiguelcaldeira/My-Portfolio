This project is a program in Python to study Decision Trees. The intent of the program is to build a decision tree with a given data while optimizing the tree itself and solution. The DTL algorithm was used to learn and deduct the decision tree from the data. However this algorithm has some limitations, namely the Overfitting problem and dealing with data noise. The presented program dealt with this algorithm limitations by implementing decision tree pruning, using the early-stop technique to deal with data noise and cross validation to deal with Overfitting.

Final Grade 20/20.
