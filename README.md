# Featured Projects
The projects and fields of Computer Science that I enjoyed the most.

## [Artificial Intelligence - Ricochet Robots - Python](https://github.com/joaomiguelcaldeira/my-portfolio/tree/master/Bachelor-Projects/Ricochet-Robots)

This project is a program made in Python to solve the game [Ricochet-Robots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricochet_Robot) in the least amount of plays possible in the quickest time. The program consists of a program that builds a structure that will store the board and its' components (Robots and Walls), and will search the solution in a search tree using a given algorithm. To reach the best solution, various algorithms were tested and the results concluded that the best algorithm for this problem was the RBFS (Recursive Best First Search). However the project author's are aware that there can be a better solution using a better heuristic with more information, in which other algorithms would performe better over the RBFS, that has some limitations. For instance, with a quality heuristic the A* algorithm would perform better than the RBFS, having a low branching factor.

## [Artificial Intelligence - Decision Trees - Python](https://github.com/joaomiguelcaldeira/my-portfolio/tree/master/Bachelor-Projects/Decision-Trees)

This project is a program in Python to study Decision Trees. The intent of the program is to build a decision tree with a given data while optimizing the tree itself and solution. The DTL algorithm was used to learn and deduct the decision tree from the data. However this algorithm has some limitations, namely the Overfitting problem and dealing with data noise. The presented program dealt with this algorithm limitations by implementing decision tree pruning, using the early-stop technique to deal with data noise and cross validation to deal with Overfitting.

## [Analysis and Synthesis of Algorithms - Grade Predictor - C++](https://github.com/joaomiguelcaldeira/my-portfolio/tree/master/Bachelor-Projects/Grade-Predictor)

This project is a program made in C++ to predict the grade of a student’s project based on the grade of the student’s test by also knowing that students frequently exchange project solutions between them. This solution uses a graph to describe the relations between students, and uses a DFS to search for the highest grade in a circle of friends and apply it’s spread between them. This is the same as searching for the strongly connected components in the graph and searching for the highest grade in each SCC to get the best prediction of the students grades.

## [Analysis and Synthesis of Algorithms - Maximum-Flow-COVID-19 - C++](https://github.com/joaomiguelcaldeira/my-portfolio/tree/master/Bachelor-Projects/Maximum-Flow-COVID-19)

This project is a program made in C++ with the objective to calculate the maximum number of residents of a given city that can go to a supermarket without crossing eachothers paths given the current COVID-19 pandemic situation. The problem considers all the cities with a square pattern with straight streets going from East to West or North to South. Therefore the student describes the city in it’s solution as a quadrangular graph with vertex capacities and calculates the maximum flow, using Dinic’s algorithm, of that graph given a super source (the residents) and a super target (the supermarkets). The maximum flow shall be equal to the maximum number of people that can go to the supermarket safely.

## [Introduction to Algorithms and Data Structures -  Friendly Football Games Data Management - C](https://github.com/joaomiguelcaldeira/my-portfolio/tree/master/Bachelor-Projects/Friendly%20Football%20Games%20Data%20Management)

This project is a program made in C with the objective to develop a database management system of friendly football games. The system holds a database of the teams and games. The person interacts with the program through the command line giving certain commands to do specific actions. It is used a hashing table and a double linked list to store and search the data efficiently.
