Implementation of a Meldable Heap Data Structure through heap commands that perform heap operations.
The base structure is a binomial heap that holds an integer value.
The Operations are:
- S: showNode
- P: showHeaps
- V: set (changes the value of a node)
- U: meld (merges 2 heaps)
- R: decreaseKey (decreases value of node and rearranges tree if necessary)
- M: min (returns the minimum value in the heap)
- A: argMin (returns the node with the min value of the heap)
- E: extractMin (removes the argMin node)
- D: delete (deletes a node from the tree)
